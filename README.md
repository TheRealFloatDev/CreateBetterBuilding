# Welcome to Create: Better Building
**Create: Better Building** is a mod that aims to enhance the building experience in your Create worlds.

It does so by adding a variety of new Create- & Factory-themed blocks and its variants, to give you more variety and creative freedom in choosing a block palette for your buildings.

All blocks are fully survival friendly and come with crafting recipes.

_This mod is still in early development and right now, there are not that many new blocks. But I am constantly working on adding new blocks and new variants like stairs, walls, etc. to existing ones._



## Info on Version 1.3 BETA
In Version 1.3 the mod is fully being rewritten. This means better performance, Forge & Farbic Support, **BUT** right now the Handrail and Barrel are not included!!



## Better Barrels

The new redesigned barrel allows you to build more appealing medieval-themed storage rooms and is a great decoration to fill empty areas.

It comes in all vanilla wood variants.


## Handrails

The brand new handrail block allows you to add some factory-themed safety mechanisms to your factories floors.

You can now dye Stone Bricks to all vanilla dye colors and they all also have slabs, stairs and walls
This gives you more color variants for your factories, while still allowing you to build using bricks.
